          Leading the project for two years, I have emphasized attention to
          detail, particularly in accessibility. This includes ensuring the use
          of accessible colors and providing alt text for each page, making the
          data visualizations inclusive for all users.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role has involved extensive data cleaning, organization, and
          deployment, using tools such as Excel and Power BI. These efforts have
          been crucial in maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the data,
          which is vital for effective decision-making and program evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dashboards are meticulously updated on a monthly basis, reflecting
          the latest activities and insights. This consistent update cycle is
          essential for providing stakeholders with a current and comprehensive
          view of the program’s impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collaborating closely with the data analyst, we have enhanced the
          project’s scope and depth. Our efforts have led to more insightful
          visualizations, offering an accessible and detailed perspective on the
          Community Ambassadors Programs&apos; activities across diverse
          neighborhoods.

          At the heart of Skill Stacks is the user-centered UI, designed to
          create an intuitive and engaging learning environment. As the UI
          designer, I focused on crafting an interface that not only looks
          aesthetically pleasing but also facilitates easy navigation and
          interaction, ensuring that users remain at the core of the UX design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developed using React and incorporating Radix-UI, Skill Stacks offers
          a dynamic and user-friendly interface for effective learning. Our
          application&apos;s design approach makes complex functionalities
          accessible, enhancing the overall user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The backend, powered by NodeJS and Express, provides a robust and
          scalable foundation. It supports a wide range of features essential
          for a comprehensive learning tool, from private to public flashcard
          management. MongoDB serves as our database of choice, offering
          flexibility and efficiency
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the 8-week development cycle, our team embraced an agile
          methodology, focusing on iterative design and continuous improvement.
          This approach allowed us to refine our app&apos;s functionality and
          user interface, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable learning experience.

          allowed us to build a robust game that is both easy to use and
          visually stunning.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the 8 week practicum, we followed an agile workflow, planning
          sprints and iterating on features. This allowed us to quickly adapt to
          changes and improve the game as we went along.
        </p>
        <p>
          NodeJS allowed us to build a highly responsive game server that can
          handle a large number of players simultaneously. We used Express to
          build the API layer, which enabled us to create secure and reliable
          endpoints for game actions and data retrieval.

        <p>
          As part of our development process, we used Git for version control,
          pull requests, and conflict merging. This gave us the ability to
          collaborate effectively as a software development team and maintain a
          high level of code quality throughout the project.
